# Day-#2: Incident Response Basics – Linux Suspicious Bash Script Execution
# Objective:
The objective of this lab is to help students understand the core steps of incident response by investigating a suspicious bash script execution on a Linux system. Students will learn how to detect, analyze, and respond to a basic script-based intrusion.

## What is Incident Response?
**Incident Response (IR)** is the process of detecting and managing a cybersecurity incident to minimize impact and restore normal operations. This lab introduces a basic Linux scenario where an attacker’s script is executed through user error or misconfiguration.

## Incident Response Process (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)
|Phase	|Description|
|------|-------|
|1. Preparation	|Ensure logging is enabled, tools are installed, and the system is ready.|
|2. Detection and Analysis	|Identify suspicious activity using logs, running processes, and file checks.|
|3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery	|Isolate the threat, remove the script, and secure the system.|
|4. Post-Incident Activity|	Document the incident and implement prevention steps.|

## Scenario: Suspicious Script Found in /tmp
Your monitoring system flagged a suspicious file in /tmp. Upon inspection, it's a bash script (payload.sh) that connects to an unknown IP. You are tasked with investigating this incident.

## Lab Setup
### System Requirements:
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or Kali Linux
- Terminal access with sudo privileges

## Simulate the attack:
1. Create a test directory:

       mkdir ~/script-lab && cd ~/script-lab

2. Create a Bash script:

       nano fakebackup.sh

32. Paste the following content:
 
        #!/bin/bash<br>
        echo "[*] Simulating backup operation..."<br>
        sleep 60<br>

4. Make the script executable:

       chmod +x fakebackup.sh

5. Simulate the Attack / Execution Run the script in the background:

       ./fakebackup.sh &

## Step-by-Step Investigation
1. Preparation
   - Install curl, lsof, ps, and grep (usually pre-installed).
2. Detection and Analysis
   - Check running processes:
 
        ps aux | grep fakebackup.sh

  - Search for suspicious files:

       find /tmp -name "*.sh"

3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Kill any related processes:
pkill curl
Remove the malicious script:
rm -f /tmp/payload.sh
Clear the crontab if persistence was found:
crontab -e
Restart services if needed and log out inactive sessions.
4. Post-Incident Activity
Document:

What triggered the alert?

What was the script doing?

Which user executed it?

Recommendations:

Enable file integrity monitoring (e.g., AIDE).

Restrict /tmp execution using mount options (noexec).

Educate users about unknown script execution.

Lab Checklist
✅ Simulate Script Create and execute a suspicious bash script
✅ Investigate Logs Use commands to analyze the event
✅ Kill and Delete Contain and remove the malicious file
✅ Document Findings Note IPs, users, and recommendations
