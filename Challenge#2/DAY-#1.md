# Day-1: Introduction to Wireshark – Packet Analysis for SOC Analysts
## Objective:
The objective of this lab is to introduce students to Wireshark, a powerful packet analysis tool used by SOC analysts to investigate network traffic. Students will learn the interface, how to capture packets, apply filters, and identify suspicious communication patterns.

## Lab Setup
### System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, Linux, or macOS
- **Network Adapter:** Required for packet capture

### Software Required
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (latest stable version)<br>
- [Download Sample PCAP file](https://github.com/KarthikSArkasali/30-Days-SOC-Challenge/blob/main/Challenge%232/Protocol_Analysis_pcap.pcapng)

## YouTube Tutorial Video
- **Watch:** [Wireshark for Beginners – Hands-On Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmLH0c5YUJk)
- **Duration:** 15 minutes

## What is Wireshark?
**Wireshark** is an open-source network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively browse network traffic. It allows analysts to view data packets flowing in and out of a system in real time or from saved PCAP files.

### Wireshark Use Cases for SOC Analysts
- **Incident Investigation:** Analyze malicious traffic patterns (e.g., C2 communication, lateral movement)
- **Malware Analysis:** Extract indicators like domains, IPs, and payloads from suspicious network behavior
- **Threat Hunting:** Detect anomalies like DNS tunneling, beaconing, or unauthorized FTP/SSH usage
- **Protocol Troubleshooting:** Identify service failures, misconfigurations, or latency issues
