# Day-2: Wireshark Basics – ICMP Protocol Analysis
## Objective:
The objective of this lab was to understand and analyze ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets using Wireshark. I identified echo requests and replies, interpreted ICMP packet fields, and applied relevant filters to investigate network activity.

## Lab Setup
### System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 (or Linux/macOS)
- Software: Wireshark (latest version)

## Files Needed
- [Download Sample PCAP file](https://github.com/KarthikSArkasali/30-Days-SOC-Challenge/blob/main/Files/Protocol_Analysis_pcap.pcapng)

## ICMP Packet Structure and Fields
ICMP is a Layer 3 protocol used for sending error messages and operational information. The most common ICMP messages include Echo Request (Type 8) and Echo Reply (Type 0).

### Key ICMP Fields:
|Field Name|	Description|
|------|----------------------|
|Type	|Defines the ICMP message type|
|Code	|Provides further detail for the type|
|Checksum	|Error-checking for header|
|Identifier|	Helps match requests and replies|
|Sequence No.	|Sequence of the request/reply|
|Data	|Optional payload|

## Most Common ICMP Display Filters
Use these filters in Wireshark’s Display Filter bar:

|Filter|	Description|
|------|----------------------|
|`icmp`	|Show all ICMP traffic|
|`icmp.type == 8`	|Show Echo Requests (ping)|
|`icmp.type == 0`	|Show Echo Replies|
|`icmp.code == 3`	|Destination unreachable|
|`ip.addr == 192.168.1.10`	|ICMP traffic from/to specific host|

## Conclusion
- ICMP is a fundamental protocol for network troubleshooting.
- Wireshark helps visualize ICMP packet flow and structure.
- Understanding ICMP helps detect network scanning, ping sweeps, and unreachable hosts.
