# Day-#2- Splunk Basics: Ingesting Linux Logs.md
## Lab Title: Splunk Basics – DNS Log Analysis
## Objective
In this lab, you will:

- Learn how to ingest and analyze DNS logs in Splunk.
- Understand how to extract useful information such as DNS query types, source hosts, and common destinations.
- Practice building basic SPL (Search Processing Language) queries to investigate DNS activity.

## Lab Setup
- **Splunk:** Already installed and accessible.
- **Data Source:** JSON-formatted Zeek DNS logs.
- **Log File:** Download the file below and place it in a directory accessible to Splunk for ingestion.
📥 Download sample dns file

⚙️ Steps to Upload DNS Log into Splunk
Go to Splunk Web → Settings > Add Data.
Choose Upload and select the file dns.log.
Set Source type: json or create a custom source type dns.
Index: Choose main or create a new index like dns_lab.
Finish the upload and confirm indexing.
🔍 Lab Tasks
Use SPL queries to answer the following:

✅Task 1: Identify the most frequently queried domain names
index=dns_lab sourcetype="json"
| stats count by query
| sort -count
✅Task 2: Find the most active user IPs generating DNS traffic
index=dns_lab sourcetype="json"
| stats count by "id.orig_h"
| sort -count
✅Task 3: Breakdown of DNS query types (A, AAAA, CNAME, PTR)
index=dns_lab sourcetype="json"
| stats count by qtype
📸Submission
