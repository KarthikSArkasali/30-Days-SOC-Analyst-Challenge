# Day#18- Splunk Basics: Investigating SSH Brute Force attack

## Objective
Learn to use Splunk to detect and investigate an SSH brute-force attack by analyzing failed login logs and identifying suspicious IPs using basic SPL queries.

## Lab Setup
- Ubuntu Server (22.04 or later)
- [Download Linux Auth log sample]()
  
## Pre-requisite
- [Setting up Splunk Server on Ubuntu Server]()

## Lab Task
Submit the answers below along with screenshots from your Splunk queries.

- Question 1: Which user has attempted most number of SSH brute attack attempt?

- Question 2: What is the IP Address of the user “thor”?

- Question 3: How many times user “thor” failed to login?

## Conclusion
You used Splunk to spot repeated SSH login failures, identify attacker IPs, and understand how brute-force attacks appear in log data — a key SOC analyst skill.
