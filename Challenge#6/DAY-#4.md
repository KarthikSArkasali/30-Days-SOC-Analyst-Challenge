# Day-#4: EDR Basics - Detecting Suspicious Network Traffic using Suricata
## Objective:
I understood how an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution detects suspicious network traffic using Suricata IDS and how to visualize alerts on Wazuh.

## What is Suspicious Network Traffic?
Suspicious network traffic refers to abnormal or unexpected activities on a network that may indicate malicious intent or an ongoing attack.

## Examples:
- A machine scanning multiple ports on the network (e.g., Nmap Scan).
- Traffic to known malicious IPs (Command & Control).
- FTP uploads on non-standard ports.
- HTTP connections to rare domains or IPs.

## How are IDSs Helpful?
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) provide the following benefits:
- Monitor and inspect network traffic in real time.
- Trigger alerts when known attack patterns are detected.
- Help detect reconnaissance, malware communication, and lateral movement.
- Provide visibility to SOC teams for early-stage attacks.

## How Does IDS Work?
- **Packet Capture:** Captures and inspects each packet.
- **Rule Matching:** Matches traffic patterns against rule sets.
- **Alerting:** Triggers alerts when rules are matched.
- **Integration:** Sends logs/alerts to SIEM platforms like Wazuh.

## What is Suricata?
Suricata is an open-source, high-performance network IDS, IPS, and network monitoring engine.

### Features:
- Deep packet inspection
- Multi-threaded architecture
- Protocol identification (HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc.)
- JSON log output for easy integration
- Community rules for threat detection

## Lab Setup
|Component	|Description|
|------|----------|
|**Wazuh Server**	|Ubuntu Server with Wazuh Manager & Dashboard|
|**Wazuh Agent**|	Ubuntu with Suricata installed|
|**Attacker Machine**	|Kali Linux (for simulating attacks)|

## Task: Detecting Port Scanning using Suricata + Wazuh

**Step 1: Installing Suricata and Rules**
1. Install Suricata:

       sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install suricata -y

2. Download and extract the Emerging Threats Suricata ruleset:

       cd /tmp/ && curl -LO https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-6.0.8/emerging.rules.tar.gz
       sudo tar -xvzf emerging.rules.tar.gz && sudo mkdir /etc/suricata/rules && sudo mv rules/*.rules /etc/suricata/rules/
       sudo chmod 640 /etc/suricata/rules/*.rules


3. Restart the Suricata service:

       sudo systemctl restart suricata

4. Add the following configuration to the /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf file of the Wazuh agent. This allows the Wazuh agent to read the Suricata logs file:

       <ossec_config>
         <localfile>
          <log_format>json</log_format>
          <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
        </localfile>
       </ossec_config>

Step 2: Simulate Attack using Kali Linux
On Kali Linux terminal, run a SYN scan:

    nmap -sS -T4 <target-ip>

- `-sS`: SYN scan
- `-T4`: Faster scan timing

This scan should trigger Suricata detection rules for port scanning.

Step 3: View Alerts in Wazuh Dashboard
- Login to `Wazuh Dashboard`.
- Navigate to `Security Events` â†’ `Choose agent`.
- Filter by Rule Group: `Suricata`
- Look for alert like: **ET SCAN Nmap Synchronous Scan**

## Learning Outcome
By completing this lab, you will:

- Understand the basics of IDS and Suricata.
- Install and configure Suricata to monitor traffic.
- Detect and respond to a port scanning attack.
- Visualize network alerts on Wazuh SIEM.
- Gain hands-on experience with EDR concepts.
