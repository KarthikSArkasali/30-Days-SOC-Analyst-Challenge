# Day-4: Log Analysis Basics – Network-Based Attack Detection Using UFW

## 🎯 Objective:
The objective of this lab is to simulate a network-based port scan attack and demonstrate how to detect it using ufw.log logs on a Linux system. Students will learn how to launch the HTTP scan prob from Kali Linux(attacker) machine and detect these scan ataempt on Victim machine using UFW.

## Lab Setup
### System Requirements
- Attacker Machine:: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: Ubuntu Linux
### Tools Needed
- `nmap` (on attacker machine)
- `ufw` or `iptables` (on target machine)
### Log Files
- `/var/log/ufw.log` on Ubuntu Server– Captures system and network-related messages

## What is a Network Port Scan?
A **port scan** is a technique used by attackers to probe a system for open ports and active services. Tools like nmap are commonly used to map a system’s network surface.

### Why It’s Dangerous
- Port scans are often a precursor to exploitation
- They help attackers identify vulnerable services like open SSH, FTP, or outdated web servers

## What is Nmap?
- Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open-source network scanning tool.
- Used to discover hosts and services on a network.
- Helps in identifying open ports, running services, and OS detection.
- Commonly used for network inventory and vulnerability scanning.

### Nmap Popular Scan Types
- **SYN Scan (-sS):** Fast and stealthy port scan.
- **TCP Connect Scan (-sT):** Full TCP connection, less stealthy.
- **UDP Scan (-sU):** Scans UDP ports for services.
- **Ping Scan (-sn):** Checks which hosts are up, no port scan.

## What is UFW?
- UFW stands for Uncomplicated Firewall, a frontend for iptables.
- Simplifies firewall management for Linux users.
- Used to allow, deny, and manage traffic rules easily.
- Logs are stored in `/var/log/ufw.log`.
- Rule file `/etc/ufw/before.rules`
- To check ufw status `ufw status`
- To check the rule number `ufw status numbered`

### UFW Rule Syntax

- **Basic allow rule:** ufw allow
- **Deny a port:** ufw deny
- **Allow by service:** ufw allow (e.g., ufw allow ssh)
- **Allow by IP:** ufw allow from
- **Allow specific port from IP:** ufw allow from to any port
- **Delete rule:** ufw delete allow

## Lab Task: Explore and Analyze Linux Syslog for Network Scans

## Step 1: Attack Simulation – Perform a Port Scan
Only scan systems you own or are authorized to test.

### On the Attacker Machine:

     nmap -p80 TARGET-IP

## Step 2: Detection and Analysis – Analyze Syslog
Installing UFW firewall
sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw logging on
sudo ufw logging high
Create a Firewall rule to drop HTTP traffic from Attack machine
sudo ufw deny from 69.62.84.69 to any port 80 proto tcp
Reload the firewall rules to take effect
sudo ufw reload
Detect the HTTP Scanning traffic
sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log | grep "Attcker IP"
✅ Conclusion
ufw.log, combined with firewall logs, is powerful for detecting early-stage reconnaissance
Port scanning is often the first indicator of an attacker mapping your system
Detecting and blocking IPs performing scans is a crucial step in proactive defense
📸 Submission
