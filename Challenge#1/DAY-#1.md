# Day-1: Introduction to Log Analysis

**Objective:** The goal of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with the fundamentals of log analysis. This project demonstrates how logs from both Windows and Linux systems can be generated, collected, and analyzed for security monitoring. The objective is to understand how SOC analysts utilize logs to detect and respond to security incidents, building a strong foundation in threat detection and incident analysis.<br>

## What is a Log?

A log is a record of events in a system that captures important actions like errors, warnings, or user activities. These logs contain key information such as:<br>

- Timestamp
- Event Description
- Severity (Critical, Error, Warning, Information)
- Source (User, Process, Service)<br>

Logs are essential for understanding system behavior, detecting security incidents, and conducting forensic investigations.
